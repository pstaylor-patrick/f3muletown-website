            We do not show up at F3 for ourselves. We show up for the man
            standing beside each of us.

            &quot;Here is one undeniable truth that I know about each of us, we
            need authentic relationships with other men who are working to be
            strong fathers, husbands and leaders. Isolation will destroy a man!
            We have the opportunity to change our community and the trajectory
            of our families. Getting in the best shape of your life is just a by
            product. The work out is the magnet, the relationships and community
            with other men will keep bringing you back. Lock shields with us and
            help us accomplish F3&apos;s mission to invigorate male leadership
            in our community.&quot;

              When you are first starting, it is important to remember to MODIFY
              as needed during the beatdowns. If you want to go harder - go
              harder. If you have not exercised in a long time, slow down.
              Don&apos;t hurt yourself or even worse, get discouraged. Just show
              up, work hard and give it your best. That is all that matters. We
              are not here competing against one another. We are freaking proud
              of you for showing up at 5:30 in the morning to exercise!

              Wear your regular outdoor workout clothes and, unless you have
